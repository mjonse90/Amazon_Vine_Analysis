# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to perform an analysis on one of the 50 Amazon datasets of reviews written by members of the paid Amazon Vine program. Amazon Vine pays it's members by sending them products and asking them to write a review of the product. 

I have selected the toys dataset for review. In order to conduct the analysis, I used PySpark to perform the ETL process and extract the dataset, transform the data, connect it to an Amazon Web Service RDS instance, and then load the transformed data into pgAdmin. After this, I used Pandas to determine if there is any bias toward any favorable reviews from the Vine members.

## Results



## Summary

Since these are all paid participants giving a written review, I would suggest that along with the written review that some type of survey be attached to the review process. This way, there is more insight into what led the participants to give their reviews.
